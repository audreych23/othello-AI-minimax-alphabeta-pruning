# othello-AI-minimax-alphabeta-pruning

Hello, this is my first time coding for an AI Game. I implemented the Othello/ Reversi AI with minimax and alpha beta pruning in c++.

To evaluate the leaves node, I use mobility (at early game) and greedy (at end game) heuristic.

> Mobility heuristic is how many valid move you have compared to your opponent
> 
> Greedy heuristic is the difference of amount of pieces you have with your opponent
